Understanding the dynamics of Brain Atrophy: a longitudinal study
We study the causal relationship between brain atrophy and cognition, in particular between the inter annual reduction in brain volume and the clinical diagnosis (healthy, MCI and dementia). 

\lettrine[nindent=0em,lines=3]{I} n this study we aim at studying the causal relationship between brain atrophy and cognition, in particular between the inter annual reduction in brain volume and the clinical diagnosis (healthy, MCI and dementia).
We use longitudinal data of MRI to study whether brain atrophy is a predictor of cognitive impairment at the time of the study or in the future.

Furthermore we study the confounding factors age and APOE to define a causal model between brain atrophy and cognitive performance (clinical diagnosis and cognitive test scores). 
We perform longitudinal extraction of brain volume to calculate the inter annual atrophy of brain volume using FSL SIENA.

The atrophy is calculated as the difference between brain volume normalized by the time passed between the two MRI scans in years.
